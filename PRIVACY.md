# Privacy Policy

Gemini Prompt Enhancer is a browser extension that runs entirely within your browser. The extension stores your API key locally using `chrome.storage.sync` and transmits it only to the selected language model provider over HTTPS. The extension does not collect or send any personal data to servers controlled by the developers.

## Data Collection
- **API Keys:** Stored locally in Chrome sync storage and sent only to the corresponding API endpoint when you trigger a request.
- **Prompts:** The text you send is transmitted directly to the provider's API and is not otherwise logged or shared.

## Third Parties
The extension communicates only with:
- Google Gemini API (`generativelanguage.googleapis.com`)
- OpenAI API (`api.openai.com`)
- Anthropic API (`api.anthropic.com`)

No other third-party services are contacted.

## Contact
If you have questions about this policy, please open an issue in the GitHub repository.
